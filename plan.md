- Builtin datatypes
- mutable vs immutable - difference, examples
- Assignment
- copy, slice, deepcopy and their comparison.
- collections module (deque, namedtuple, Counter)

[02_int_caching.ipynb](02_int_caching.ipynb)
- Integer and string caching QUIZ

[03_hashable.ipynb](03_hashable.ipynb)

### Internal implementation of datatypes

[04_internal_structures_of_data_types.ipynb](04_internal_structures_of_data_types.ipynb)
- list
- collections.deque
- dict
- set

### Logical operators

[05_logical_operators.ipynb](05_logical_operators.ipynb)
- Evaluation priority
- What do they return
- Lazy evaluation


### Scope (LEGB)

- Scope definition
- What is the border of scope
- How many scopes
- LEGB order
- Relative scope (the same variable could be in several scopes: global, local)
- locals(), globals()
- How python clarifies that variable is locacl or global in scope of function
